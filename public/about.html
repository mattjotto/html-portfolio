<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey - I'm Matt, I'm a cofounder of Grid, a messaging app to keep in touch with your friends and meet new people based on onlineness, proximity, shared interests and mutual friends.</p>

<p>I'm learning to code so I can be a better manager to the people I work with, and speak the same language</p>

<p> Coding is fun, and I want to get better!</p>
